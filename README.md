# Project Coffee
_This project was created when I was taking CS55 Introduction to JAVA at SMC._  
The program allows user to choose to create a new or display all drinks they have created.  
1. When creating a new drink, user needs to provide the number of ingredients of the drink and list out those ingredients.
2. When displaying all drinks created, user can see all drinks with its ingredients and price.
